      <description>Unlike the POJ (Church Romanization), Enhanced Taiwanese Romanization System is only used as phoenetic alphabets instead as a writing system. It does not used hyphen to connect a word like TL (Taiwanese Romanization System) does but attemps to transcript character by character. This system is modified from TL and has referenced from POJ to suit for both Hokkien and Hakka. Below is the charts of Enhanced Taiwanese Romanization System, or ETRS for short.</description>
