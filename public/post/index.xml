      <description>Unlike the POJ (Pe̍h-ōe-jī, Church Romanization), Enhanced Taiwanese Romanization System is only used as phoenetic alphabets instead as a writing system. It does not used hyphen to connect syllables like TL (Tâi-lô, Taiwanese Romanization System) does but transcripts character by character. This system is modified from TL and POJ to suit both Hokkien and Hakka. Below is the charts of Enhanced Taiwanese Romanization System, or ETRS for short.
Consonants    ETRS Hokkien Hakka Note     b [ b ] [ b ] In Hakka, b is only used in Chioon (詔安) dialect.</description>
